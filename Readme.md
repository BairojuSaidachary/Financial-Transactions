# Financial Transactions Database

This project establishes a robust database system for managing financial transactions within a bank. The system encompasses tables for customers, accounts, transactions, loans, and credit cards, incorporating various features such as user authentication and authorization, data validation, backup and recovery strategies, performance optimizations, and reporting capabilities.

## Features

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**
    - Users table with hashed passwords and assigned roles (admin, manager, teller).
  
2. **Data Validation and Integrity**
    - Implementation of constraints and checks on data fields to ensure data quality.
    - Maintenance of referential integrity through foreign keys.

3. **Backup and Recovery**
    - Recommendations for regular database backups and recovery strategies via external tools and cron jobs.

4. **Performance Optimization**
    - Utilization of indexes on frequently queried columns to enhance performance.
    - Creation of views for simplified and optimized data access.
    - Implementation of stored procedures for common operations.
    - Utilization of triggers for automatic logging.

5. **Reporting and Analytics**
    - Provision of views for aggregated and formatted data.
    - Example queries catered to common reporting needs.

## Tables

1. **Customers**
    - `CustomerID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Address`, `DateOfBirth`, `CreatedAt`

2. **Accounts**
